# Download & Use datasets

In the zip folder, there are 5 data files. 

chat.csv:
This file will be used for LIN_205_Custom_Embedding.ipynb

custom_glove_100d.txt:

This file can be generated from running LIN_205_Custom_Embedding.ipnb.
If you'd like to run LIN205_RNN_LSTM.ipynb without training the word embedding model again, you can simply use this txt file.

train_data_1400_pos:
dataset for positive socioemotional category. Download for running LIN205_Naive Bayes.ipynb & LIN205_RNN_LSTM.ipynb

train_data_1400_neg:
dataset for negative socioemotional category. Download for running LIN205_Naive Bayes.ipynb & LIN205_RNN_LSTM.ipynb

train_data_1400_task:
dataset for task-focused category. Download for running LIN205_Naive Bayes.ipynb & LIN205_RNN_LSTM.ipynb

<b>NOTE</b>
glove.6B.100d.txt should be downloaded personally. I could not upload the file on github because the size of the datafile was too big. You can find the word embedding model here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
